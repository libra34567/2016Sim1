Symetric对称 key cryptography
Same key used for encryption and decrption


Diffie-Hellman-Merkle key exchange scheme:
Both side know the number 5 and 7. Both think up random number 
3 and 4
5^4(mod 7) = !2		5^3(mod 7) = !6
!6^4(mod 7) = 1		!2^4(mod 7)  =1

since a^x(mod b) is easy to calculate but hard to invert it's hard for others to work out the key



Asymmetric key cryptography, two key are used, one for encryption one for decryption

Password authentication:
Pro: simple, no need to store keys so you can login from different clients. 
they generally have password when they obtain an account

Con:
Forget pwd
people use same pwd for different system
pwd can be guessed

Public key authentication:
Provide you 2 factors, passphrase and encrypted private key. 
Weakness: Server can't check that strong passphrase are used. 
if someone able to alter the authorized key file then they could include an extra key which may not be detected. 


authorized keys:
p11
