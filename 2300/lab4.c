/*

Write a program that you could use in the place of a 6 sided dice. Simply take input from standard 
in and output the numbers random numbers to standard out. Each time the user hits the "enter" key out
 put another random number. Ctrl-d should halt the program. Typical interaction would look like:
$ ./dice
5
2
6
noting that each number is output after a enter is hit.
