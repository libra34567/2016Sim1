/*
1 bit is 1/0
4 bit is a nibble
8 bit is a byte
1/2/4/8 bytes is a word

Table of Multiples of bytes:
Lecture note04, page 3

Mbps - mega bits per second
MIPS - million instructions per second. 
FLOPS - Floating point operations per second. 

Character is stores in table, chars can be stored using number. 
3 standards:
ASCII
EBCDIC
UTF-8

Strings:
Array of char with "null char"/0 to terminate. 
0x43 =>C
0x4F =>O

??how to know which standards?

Endianness 字节顺序
Refers to the order of the bytes within a single word are stored within main memory
Big-endian machine: store MSB first (lowest address order)
Little-endian machine: LSB first (lowest address order)
mostly little-endian!!
