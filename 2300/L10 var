The var

Scope:
Var defeind within block are local and initialized every time block is executed. 
Var defined~~~ but with static are only init once and are permanent. 

Var define outside of a block are global and permanent. (the
static keyword reduces the scope to the file it is within).

int iam_global;
static int iam_global_with_reduced_scope;
int function() {
 int iam_local_to_this_function;
 static int also_local_but_permanent;
}
